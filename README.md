# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Naymur Rahman Abir
## Full Stack Developer (MERN) / Software Engineer


As I Studied Computer Science & Engineering, I am Learning MERN stack Development for implementing a web-based application. I have knowledge and experience in JavaScript and Collection Framework. I have a comprehensive understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle. 

I have experience in HTML5, CSS3, Github, ES, API, JavaScript, JSON, Tailwind, Bootstrap, React, React Router, Firebase, NodeJS, ExpressJS MongoDB with responsive web applications using React JS libraries. 
I am a self-motivated individual with good communication skills and leadership qualities.

I would like to introduce myself as I believe I have the skills, qualifications, and experience necessary to make a significant contribution to any organization.

I have completed my BSc in CSE degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of Bangladesh Army University of Engineering & Technology (BAUET). 

My keen interest in Computer Science and Engineering has enabled me to develop a good knowledge of Web Applications and IT. I have a one-month Internship from my University of experience in Contribution to Web Applications and IT & Communication. 

That enhanced my technological capacity and performance. However, I can assure you that I am a quick learner, adaptive as well as an energetic person.

Skills: HTML5 / CSS3, Github / ES, ES6 / API / JavaScript / JSON / Tailwind / Bootstrap / React / React Router / Firebase /  NodeJS / ExpressJS / MongoDB
